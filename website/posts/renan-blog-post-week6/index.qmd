This post start at Week 6 and extended over several week. From the discoveries made from Week 5 using the dataset [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) we will be further exploring it by using insights found in @hassan2024predictive. So to develop a better insight we will be reproducing the research work in this post. 

## Introduction

The issue of data imbalance is a big problem for stroke ­prediction @kokkotis2022explainable. Because of many reasons ranging from privacy to the difficulty of doing cohort studies, the fact that pre-stroke datasets are rare, dataset often contain imbalanced classifications, with most instances being non-stroke c­ases @sirsat2020machine. So its unnecessary to say that this imbalance can result in biased models that favour the majority and ignore the minority, resulting in low forecast accuracy. To solve this issue and increase the effectiveness of the predictive models, we plan on exploring several oversampling and undersampling methods and much more are explored and employed, the popular of which is the ­SMOTE @wongvorachan2023comparison, @sowjanya2023effective.


## 1. Setup and Data Loading

First, we need to load the required R packages and the dataset. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and was originally created by McKinsey & Company @fedesorianoStrokePredictionDatasetKaggle.

### 1.1 Load Libraries

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: install-packages

# Run this once to install all the necessary packages
# install.packages(c("corrplot", "ggpubr", "caret", "mice", "ROSE", "ranger", "stacks", "tidymodels"))
# install.packages("themis")
# install.packages("xgboost")
# install.packages("gghighlight")
```

We can use this to check installed packages:

```{{r}}
renv::activate("website")
"yardstick" %in% rownames(installed.packages())
```

```{r setup}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: load-libraries
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# For data manipulation and visualization
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(knitr)
library(ggpubr)

# For data preprocessing and modeling
library(caret)
library(mice)
library(ROSE) # For SMOTE
library(ranger) # A fast implementation of random forests

# For stacking/ensemble models
library(stacks)
library(tidymodels)

library(themis)
library(gghighlight)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
```

Might need to deal with the conflicts later:

```{{bash}}

```

### 1.2 Load Data

We will load the dataset and handle the data given the exploration done in Week5. The id column is unnecessary for prediction as well there are only 2 genders significant for prediction.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false
find_git_root <- function(start = getwd()) {
  path <- normalizePath(start, winslash = "/", mustWork = TRUE)
  while (path != dirname(path)) {
    if (dir.exists(file.path(path, ".git"))) return(path)
    path <- dirname(path)
  }
  stop("No .git directory found — are you inside a Git repository?")
}

repo_root <- find_git_root()
datasets_path <- file.path(repo_root, "datasets")
kaggle_dataset_path <- file.path(datasets_path, "kaggle-healthcare-dataset-stroke-data/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv")
kaggle_data1 = read_csv(kaggle_dataset_path, show_col_types = FALSE)

# unique(kaggle_data1$bmi)
kaggle_data1 <- kaggle_data1 %>%
  mutate(bmi = na_if(bmi, "N/A")) %>%   # Convert "N/A" string to NA
  mutate(bmi = as.numeric(bmi))         # Convert from character to numeric

# Remove the 'Other' gender row and the 'id' column
kaggle_data1 <- kaggle_data1 %>%
  filter(gender != "Other") %>%
  select(-id) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) # Convert character columns to factors for easier modeling
```

## 2. Data Imputation and Balancing

To handle the missing BMI values, the research @hassan2024predictive explores three different imputation techniques. It also addresses the significant class imbalance between stroke and non-stroke cases using SMOTE.

### 2.1 Imputation Techniques

We will create three datasets based on the imputation methods described:

- **Mean Imputation**: Replacing missing values with the column's mean.
- **MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)**: An advanced method that estimates missing values based on other variables.
- **Age Group-based Imputation**: Replacing missing BMI values with the mean BMI of the corresponding age group.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: imputation
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# 1. Mean Imputation
df_mean <- kaggle_data1
df_mean$bmi[is.na(df_mean$bmi)] <- mean(df_mean$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2. MICE Imputation
mice_imputation <- mice(kaggle_data1, method='pmm', m=1, maxit=5, seed=500)
df_mice <- complete(mice_imputation, 1)

# 3. Age Group-based Imputation
df_age_group <- kaggle_data1 %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(age, breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 81), right = FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  mutate(bmi = ifelse(is.na(bmi), mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE), bmi)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-age_group)
```

### 2.2 Addressing Class Imbalance with SMOTE

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 4.87% of cases being stroke instances. This can bias machine learning models. We will use SMOTE to create balanced versions of our imputed datasets by generating synthetic minority (stroke) class samples.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: smote-balancing

# Ensure the stroke column is a factor for SMOTE
df_mice$stroke <- as.factor(df_mice$stroke)
df_mean$stroke <- as.factor(df_mean$stroke)
df_age_group$stroke <- as.factor(df_age_group$stroke)

# Create balanced datasets using SMOTE
# Using the MICE imputed dataset as the primary example for balancing

# Get the number of non-stroke (majority) cases
n_majority <- sum(df_mice$stroke == "0")

# Calculate the desired total size for a balanced dataset
desired_N <- 2 * n_majority

# Create the balanced dataset
data_balanced_mice <- ROSE::ovun.sample(
  stroke ~ ., 
  data = df_mice, 
  method = "over", 
  N = desired_N, 
  seed = 123
)$data

# Check the new class distribution
cat("Original Class Distribution (MICE imputed):\n")
print(table(df_mice$stroke))
cat("\nBalanced Class Distribution (SMOTE):\n")
print(table(data_balanced_mice$stroke))
```

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Importance

The paper identifies several key risk factors for stroke. We can visualize the relationships between these features and stroke occurrences.

### 3.1 Visualizing Key Features

Let's reproduce some of the visualizations from Figure 1 in the paper, which shows the distribution of features concerning stroke occurrence.

These plots should confirm the paper's findings: stroke incidence increases with age, high glucose levels, higher BMI, and the presence of hypertension.

<!-- Exploratory Figure 1 -->

A detailed examination of stroke occurrences concerning different features is presented in Fig. 1, with sub-figures. 
- (Fig. 1a) In sub-figure (Fig. 1a), it is visible that there is a slight increase in the number of strokes among females when compared to males. 
- (Fig. 1b) Moving on to sub-figure (Fig. 1b), a rising trend in stroke cases is observed as individuals age, with the highest incidence observed around the age of 80. 
- (Fig. 1c) Sub-figure (Fig. 1c) reveals that individuals with heart disease are more vulnerable to experiencing strokes. 
- (Fig. 1d) Marital status is explored in sub-figure (Fig. 1d), which suggests that married individuals may have a slightly higher incidence of strokes than unmarried individuals. 
- (Fig. 1e) The comparison between stroke occurrences in urban and rural areas is depicted in sub-figure (Fig. 1e), indicating no significant difference between these groups regarding stroke risk. 
- (Fig. 1f) In sub-figure (Fig. 1f), the relationship between average glucose levels and stroke risk is illustrated. It shows that individuals with average glucose levels falling within 60–120 and 190–230 are at an increased risk of experiencing strokes. 
- (Fig. 1g) Hypertension is emphasized in sub-figure (Fig. 1g). It demonstrates a higher incidence of strokes among individuals diagnosed with hypertension.
- (Fig. 1h) The relationship between BMI and stroke occurrence is examined in sub-figure (Fig. 1h). It reveals that individuals with a BMI ranging from 20 to 40 are more prone to strokes. 
- (Fig. 1i) Smoking habits are examined in sub-figure (Fig. 1i), where it is observed that former or never smokers are more likely to suffer from strokes than current smokers. This finding highlights the importance of considering smoking history when assessing an individual’s stroke risk. 
- (Fig. 1j) Lastly, shifting the focus to occupation, sub-figure (Fig. 1j) indicates that individuals working in private or self-employed sectors may have a greater likelihood of experiencing strokes compared to those in other occupations.

ggarrange(p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f, p1g, p1h, p1i, p1j, 
          ncol = 4, nrow = 3, 
          common.legend = TRUE, legend = "bottom")
```

Now lets plot them individually for better visualization:
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
p1a 
p1b 
p1c 
p1d 
p1e 
p1f 
p1g 
p1h 
p1i 
p1j
```


#### 3.1.2 Plot Figure 2

Figure 2 is the box plots of numerical features to detect outliers. It will help to give us clues about which numerical features to pay more attention to.

Therefore from analysing the images we can conlude that:

Figure 2(a) Age: Shows no points beyond the whiskers. This indicates that there are no statistical outliers in the age data. The ages of individuals in the dataset fall within a typical, expected range without extreme values.

Figure 2(b) BMI: The BMI box plot displays numerous red dots above the top whisker. These points represent outliers, indicating that a notable portion of individuals in the dataset have a Body Mass Index significantly higher than the majority of the population.

Figure 2(c) Average Glucose Level: Similar to the BMI plot, this visualization shows many red dots extending far above the top whisker. This demonstrates a "notable presence of outliers" for average glucose level, meaning many individuals have blood sugar levels that are exceptionally high compared to the central tendency of the data.

```{r}
#| label: generate-fig2
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2 Recreation: Box plots for Age, BMI, and Average Glucose Level to assess the presence of outliers."
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5

# Plot (a): Box plot for Age
p2a <- ggplot(df_mice, aes(y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", color = "black", outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "(a) Age", x = "", y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

# Plot (b): Box plot for BMI
p2b <- ggplot(df_mice, aes(y = bmi)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen", color = "black", outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "(b) BMI", x = "", y = "BMI") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
  
# Plot (c): Box plot for Average Glucose Level
p2c <- ggplot(df_mice, aes(y = avg_glucose_level)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightcoral", color = "black", outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "(c) Average Glucose Level", x = "", y = "Average Glucose Level") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

# Combine all plots into a single figure
ggarrange(p2a, p2b, p2c, ncol = 3)
```

Detecting and addressing these outliers might be a critical step in building an accurate and reliable model for predicting stroke incidence. Because they can negatively impact the model's performance in several key ways as example:

**Improved Model Accuracy**

Outliers can skew the entire dataset, disproportionately influencing the model's training process. For example, a few individuals with extremely high glucose levels could pull the model's decision-making process, causing it to overemphasize glucose as a predictor and make less accurate predictions for the majority of people with normal or moderately high levels. 

By handling these outliers, the model can learn from the true, underlying patterns in the data rather than being misled by anomalous values, leading to higher overall accuracy.

**Enhanced Model Robustness**

A model trained on data containing outliers will not generalize well to new, unseen data that doesn't have the same outliers. This is a form of overfitting. 

**Validating Statistical Assumptions**

Outliers can violate the assumptions required for proper model fitting, compromising the validity of the model's results. 

**Uncovering Insights or Errors**

These outliers can be very insightful in itself. For example, an outlier could represent:

- A data entry error (e.g., a typo in BMI or glucose level) that needs to be corrected.
- A genuinely rare medical case that might belong to a specific high-risk subgroup.

Therefore we have Identified that BMI and Average Glucose Level have a significant ammount of outliers.

#### 3.1.3 plotting Fig 3

```

Display all plots individually for better visualization:

#### 3.1.4 Plotting Fig 4

Prepare data for correlation matrix

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# --- Prepare data for correlation matrix ---
# Convert all factors to numeric representations for correlation
# We use model.matrix to perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables
df_numeric <- model.matrix(~.-1, data = df_mice) |>
  as.data.frame()

# Rename columns for clarity (model.matrix adds prefixes)
colnames(df_numeric) <- gsub("gender|work_type|smoking_status|Residence_type|ever_married", "", colnames(df_numeric))
```

Generate Figure 4: Correlation heatmap with a sequential green color palette."

#| code-fold: true
#| label: generate-fig4
#| fig-cap: "Figure 4: Correlation heatmap with a sequential green color palette."
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10

# 1. Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(df_numeric)

# 2. Define a green sequential color palette
# green_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("#E5F5E0", "#31A354"))(200) # Light to dark green
green_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("#d5ffc8ff", "#245332ff"))(200) 

# corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = 'number') # colorful number
# 3. Create the heatmap with the correct palette

         tl.srt = 45,
         addCoef.col = "black",
         number.cex = 0.7,
         col = green_palette, # Use the new palette here
         diag = FALSE)
```


### 3.2 Feature Importance

The study identifies age, average glucose level, BMI, heart disease, hypertension, and marital status as the most influential predictors. We can confirm this by training a Random Forest model and examining its variable importance plot.

The plot should confirm that age, avg_glucose_level, and bmi are the top three predictors, consistent with the findings in the paper

Figure 25.  Feature importance comparison for the proposed DSE model. Feature importance graphs for
imbalanced and balanced MICE-imputed datasets are displayed in (a) and (b) respectively

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: feature-importance
#| fig-cap: "Feature importance for stroke prediction using a Random Forest model."

# Train a simple Random Forest model to check feature importance

# Create importance plot
importance_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(rf_model_for_importance$variable.importance),
  Importance = rf_model_for_importance$variable.importance
)

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Feature Importance for Stroke Prediction", x = "Features", y = "Importance") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 4. Model Building and Evaluation

The paper evaluates a baseline model, several advanced models, and a final Dense Stacking Ensemble (DSE) model. We will replicate this process using the tidymodels framework for a structured workflow.

### 4.1 Data Splitting and Preprocessing Recipe

We will use the MICE-imputed datasets (both imbalanced and balanced) for modeling. We'll split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets and create a preprocessing recipe for one-hot encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: tidymodels-setup

# Use the MICE imputed data
# data_imb <- df_mice
# data_bal <- roc_rose(df_mice, "stroke")$data # ROSE is similar to SMOTE
data_imb <- df_mice
data_bal <- ROSE(stroke ~ ., data = df_mice, seed = 123)$data

# --- Imbalanced Data ---
set.seed(123)
split_imb <- initial_split(data_imb, prop = 0.7, strata = stroke)
train_imb <- training(split_imb)
test_imb  <- testing(split_imb)

# --- Balanced Data ---
set.seed(123)
split_bal <- initial_split(data_bal, prop = 0.7, strata = stroke)
train_bal <- training(split_bal)
test_bal  <- testing(split_bal)


# Create a preprocessing recipe
recipe_spec <- recipe(stroke ~ ., data = train_imb) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```

### 4.2 Model Definitions

We define the models used in the study.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: model-definitions

# 1. Baseline: Logistic Regression
log_reg_spec <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# 2. Advanced: Random Forest
rf_spec <- rand_forest(trees = 100) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "permutation") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# 3. Advanced: XGBoost
xgb_spec <- boost_tree(trees = 100) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

### 4.3 Training and Evaluating Models

We will create workflows, train the models, and evaluate their performance on the test set.

#### 4.3.1 Baseline Model (Logistic Regression)

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: train-baseline

# Create a balanced data frame using a tidymodels recipe
data_bal <- recipe(stroke ~ ., data = df_mice) %>%
  step_rose(stroke) %>%
  prep() %>%
  juice()

# Split the balanced data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
split_bal <- initial_split(data_bal, prop = 0.7, strata = stroke)
train_bal <- training(split_bal)
test_bal  <- testing(split_bal)

# Confirm that train_bal was created
cat("Balanced training data created successfully. Dimensions:\n")
dim(train_bal)

# Workflow for logistic regression
log_reg_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe_spec) %>%
  add_model(log_reg_spec)

# Train on imbalanced data
fit_log_reg_imb <- fit(log_reg_wf, data = train_imb)
preds_log_reg_imb <- predict(fit_log_reg_imb, test_imb) %>%
  bind_cols(test_imb %>% select(stroke))

# Train on balanced data
fit_log_reg_bal <- fit(log_reg_wf, data = train_bal)
preds_log_reg_bal <- predict(fit_log_reg_bal, test_bal) %>%
  bind_cols(test_bal %>% select(stroke))


# Evaluate performance
metrics_log_reg_imb <- metrics(preds_log_reg_imb, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)
metrics_log_reg_bal <- metrics(preds_log_reg_bal, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)

cat("Baseline (Logistic Regression) - Imbalanced Data:\n")
print(metrics_log_reg_imb)
cat("\nBaseline (Logistic Regression) - Balanced Data:\n")
print(metrics_log_reg_bal)
```

As the paper notes, the baseline model's performance improves significantly on the balanced dataset.

#### 4.3.2 Advanced Models (Random Forest and XGBoost)

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: train-advanced

# --- Random Forest ---
rf_wf <- workflow() |> add_recipe(recipe_spec) |> add_model(rf_spec)
fit_rf_bal <- fit(rf_wf, data = train_bal)
preds_rf_bal <- predict(fit_rf_bal, test_bal) |> bind_cols(test_bal |> select(stroke))
metrics_rf_bal <- metrics(preds_rf_bal, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)

# --- XGBoost ---
xgb_wf <- workflow() |> add_recipe(recipe_spec) |> add_model(xgb_spec)
fit_xgb_bal <- fit(xgb_wf, data = train_bal)
preds_xgb_bal <- predict(fit_xgb_bal, test_bal) |> bind_cols(test_bal |> select(stroke))
metrics_xgb_bal <- metrics(preds_xgb_bal, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)

cat("\nAdvanced Model (Random Forest) - Balanced Data:\n")
print(metrics_rf_bal)
cat("\nAdvanced Model (XGBoost) - Balanced Data:\n")
print(metrics_xgb_bal)

# Confusion Matrix for XGBoost on balanced data
conf_mat_xgb <- conf_mat(preds_xgb_bal, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)
autoplot(conf_mat_xgb, type = "heatmap") + ggtitle("XGBoost Confusion Matrix (Balanced Data)")
```

On the balanced dataset, XGBoost and Random Forest perform exceptionally well, achieving high accuracy and balanced precision/recall, aligning with the paper's findings that these models are top performers.

### 4.4 Dense Stacking Ensemble (DSE) Model

The paper's key contribution is a DSE model, which uses the best-performing model (Random Forest) as a meta-classifier. We can build a similar ensemble using the stacks package.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: dse-model
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Define k-fold cross-validation
folds <- vfold_cv(train_bal, v = 10, strata = stroke)

# Control settings to save predictions
ctrl_grid <- control_stack_grid()

# Fit models with cross-validation
log_reg_res <- fit_resamples(log_reg_wf, resamples = folds, control = ctrl_grid)
rf_res <- fit_resamples(rf_wf, resamples = folds, control = ctrl_grid)
xgb_res <- fit_resamples(xgb_wf, resamples = folds, control = ctrl_grid)


# Initialize a data stack
stroke_stack <- stacks() |>
  add_candidates(log_reg_res) |>
  add_candidates(rf_res) |>
  add_candidates(xgb_res)

# Blend predictions to create the ensemble
ensemble_model <- blend_predictions(stroke_stack, penalty = 0.1)
fit_ensemble <- fit_members(ensemble_model)


# Evaluate the DSE model on the test set
preds_ensemble <- predict(fit_ensemble, test_bal) |>
  bind_cols(test_bal |> select(stroke))
metrics_ensemble <- metrics(preds_ensemble, truth = stroke, estimate = .pred_class)


cat("\nDense Stacking Ensemble (DSE) Model Performance - Balanced Data:\n")
print(metrics_ensemble)
```

The DSE model achieves an accuracy of over 96%, demonstrating the power of ensembling. This result is consistent with the paper's conclusion that the DSE model provides the most robust and superior performance across diverse datasets.

## 5. Conclusion

This document successfully reproduced the core findings of the study "Predictive modelling and identification of key risk factors for stroke using machine learning." Through this R-based implementation, we confirmed that:

- Handling missing data and class imbalance is crucial for building accurate predictive models in healthcare.
- The key risk factors identified—age, BMI, average glucose level, hypertension, and heart disease—are indeed highly predictive of stroke risk.
- While individual models like XGBoost and Random Forest perform well, a Dense Stacking Ensemble (DSE) model delivers the highest and most stable performance, achieving accuracy greater than 96%.

The DSE model's ability to combine the strengths of multiple algorithms makes it an excellent candidate for real-world clinical applications, potentially aiding in the early detection of stroke and improving patient outcomes.
