(2)\nAuthors: Johannes Prottengeier, Isabelle Kaiser, Andreas Moritz, Fabian Konrad\nProblem: - Airplane headache (AH) is a headache disorder described as a headache induced while taking off or landing in an airplane. It was not until 2004 that the disorder was recognized and classified as a medical issue. Because this disorder has just recently been recognized, there is little existing research on it. - There is a lot of previous literature and research regarding other headache types and disorders, but AH is still lacking appropriate research. - Specifically, this study aims to identify predictors and risk factors that occur before onset of airplane headache. Knowing the predictors would help both travelers and employees of airlines. - AH is a common disorder affecting about 65 million people worldwide every year, so helping prevent and treat it is crucial. Future research is therefore a must.\nSolution: - Conduct a logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of airplane headache. Two binary logistic regression models were constructed; one model’s outcome was either airplane headache (1) or no headache (0), and the other model’s outcomes were airplane headache (1) or other headache (0). - Used R to conduct statistical analysis\nData: - Data was collected from a voluntary online survey sent out to about 20,000 pilots who fly frequently due to work. A total of 2237 complete questionnaires from a 3 month period in 2014 were received and used in the dataset for this study. - The data/ questions in the survey were determined by pain specialists - Predictors included in the survey were: demographic information, health history, substance use, medication use, stress levels, and headache/ physical symptoms while flying. - The outcome variable was divided into three categories: airplane headache, no headache, and other type of headache. - Predictors were tested for multicollinearity before models were constructed - Data was further reduced using stepwise backward elimination (starting with all predictors and then eliminating least significant predictors)\nResults/ Conclusions: - Survey results revealed that a vast majority of participants said they had some form of headache while flying on an airplane (82%) - The first model comparing airplane headache with no headache was found to have 10 significant predictors. The AUC for this model showed that it had strong predictive power. - The second model comparing airplane headache with other headache was found to have only four significant predictors. The AUC also showed that this model had low predictive power. This is likely attributed to the fact that airplane headache and other types of headaches all have similar predictors, so it is not easy to distinguish between strong predictors for just AH as compared to all types of headaches. - Conclusions: supplementing with folic acid before flight may help reduce risk of airplane headache. Other strong predictors of airplane headache are occupation, work stress, and preexisting headache medical conditions. - Further research about airplane headache is necessary because of all the ongoing negative subsequent events caused by it. It causes people loss of productivity, avoidance behaviors, stress, and anxiety.\nLimitations: - Only 12% of surveyed individuals submitted their survey. It could be the case that only the people who suffered from headaches responded to the survey, so the proportions of individuals with airplane headache in this study are not representative of the entire population. This is called positive selection bias. - Participants in the survey may not be reporting accurate information because a lot of time passes between the event of their airplane travel and the time when they take the survey.\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Article 1\nBERT or FastText? A Comparative Analysis of Contextual as well as Non-Contextual Embeddings. (1)\nMy personal opinion: This research doesn’t explicitly state why Logistic Regression is important, but it did use it as the classifier for all of the experiments to maintain methodological simplicity. All embeddings were passed to a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classifier for classification into target labels. Which shows the versatility of logistic regression when elaborating an experiment to test a hypothesis.\nThe main goal of the paper is to analyze the effectiveness of non-contextual embeddings from BERT models (MuRIL and MahaBERT) and FastText models (IndicFT and MahaFT) for NLP tasks. The authors compare these embeddings to contextual and compressed variants of BERT aiming to fill a research gap, because previous research did not explore non-contextual embeddings.\nThe research is important because it addresses the challenges faced by NLP in low-resource languages (The ones that lack big annotated datasets to properly train). The selection of an effective embedding method is extremely important for strong NLP performance. The research tries a promising alternative, non-contextual BERT embeddings, which can be obtained through a simple table lookup, unlike contextual embeddings that require a full forward pass through the model. This is particularly relevant for getting model performance with much better computational efficiency.\nThe methodology is quite interesting. For the FastText, which is a non-contextual embedding by default, they had to create a custom vocabulary. Which was achieved by concatenating the training and validation datasets and then passing them through a text vectorizer, which generated vectors for every word in the dataset. The vectorizer returned the vocabulary as a list of words in decreasing order of their frequency. Then the FastText model was then loaded using the FastText library, and for each word in the vocabulary, a word vector was retrieved to construct the embedding matrix. For each sentence, the text was split into individual words, and the corresponding embeddings were retrieved from the embedding matrix. These embeddings were then averaged to produce the final sentence embeddings.\nFurthermore they did not stop with FastText, they also experimented with compressed embeddings by reducing the dimensionality from 768 (the traditional BERT embedding dimension) to 300. This compression was performed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant features, extracting the top 300 components for all the combinations of contextual as well as non-contextual for MahaBERT as well as Muril.\nIn this approach it’s interesting how they did use Logistic regression for simplicity. All embeddings were then passed to a multiple logistic regression(MLR) classifier for classification into target labels.\nI understood that as a result they did show that contextual BERT embeddings perform better than non-contextual ones, including both non-contextual BERT embeddings and FastText. So in the end they proved that their approach did not improve much or provided much resource to support this different approach. They also showed that when non-contextual BERT embeddings are compressed, their performance drops, and FastText performs better than compressed noncontextual BERT. But this is a questionable finding.\nThe limitations of the research is that even in most cases it was apparent that compression lowers the performance of non-contextual BERT embeddings. The effect of compression on contextual embeddings varies across datasets and there is no consistent way to properly derive conclusions."

    "text": "Article 2\nPriority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods. (2)\nThe goal of the research is to create an automated system to predict the priority of Asian giant hornet sighting reports. Asian giant hornets are an invasive species that poses a significant threat to native bee populations and local beekeeping, as well as to public safety due to their aggressive nature and potent venom. So it’s very important that reports are properly assessed for priority.\nThe authors did model the priority prediction of sighting reports as a two-classification problem. This approach was pretty clever and simple. The goal was to just classify reports as either a “true positive” or a “false positive”.\nTheir methodology is a straightforward application of logistic regression with feature extraction. They came to realize that they needed Location Feature, Time Feature, Image Feature, Text Feature.\nLocation Feature considers the probability of a hornet being observed at a specific location based on known hornet migration patterns and habits. Time Feature accounts for the hornet’s seasonal behavior. Since hornets are most active from April to December, a report submitted during this period is more likely to be positive. Image Feature is the number of images attached to a report and they came to notice that it is correlated with the increase of its credibility. Text Feature is the textual description’s length and keywords. A longer text is considered more credible because it contains more evidence. The model also uses a specific dictionary of hornet characteristics to identify relevant keywords.\nThey then used a weighted binary cross-entropy function and the logistic regression is just mapping the probability given the feature vector.\nThe model achieved an average prediction accuracy of 83.5% on positive reports with the best weighting parameter settings, but still far from other works which achieved about 93% using Deep Learning. So this is the main limitation, still needs a lot of improvement or maybe it will never outmatch other methods due to hidden limitations.\nMy opinion on this paper is that the Logistic Regression has interesting properties, after all it is a generalized linear model, which conducts mapping from any real number to probability values.\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Article 1\nIncorporating LLM Priors into Tabular Learners. (1)\nThere have been implementations of transformer based architectures for tabular data. Most of the time it has been utilized for generating synthetic data for likelihood free models or for cases where there is not enough data for fitting a model.\nThe goal of this research was to bootstrap a way so one could use off the shelf models like Chatgpt which are really good at generalization to perform similarly to dedicated models trained on tabular data such as tabLLM. This is important because it is fairly cheaper and more accessible than training a model from scratch and it overcomes the complexities of developing a specialized encoder.\nThe methodology is a pretty hacky solution where they serialized the tabular data so they could prompt the models are are just trying to obtain back a categorization through prompt engineering which will be attributed a value which is manually tuned by the authors and this value is later used on the Monotonic Logistic Regression.\nThe limitations are quite clear. There is no way to guarantee the black box model output will be consistent. You have to manually categorize and do some prompt engineering. The model has bias so it either works really well or it doesn’t.\nThe bright side is that this approach is extremely cheap and is accessible. It can be used to test ideas and hypothesis as well rapidly prototype before committing to a more definite solution such as tabLLM."

    "text": "Article 2\nUsing a monotonic density ratio model to increase the power of the goodness-of-fit test for logistic regression models with case-control data. (2)\nCase-control sampling is used because it is a quick, economical, and efficient method for studying rare diseases or outcomes, long latent periods, or outbreaks. It allows researchers to investigate multiple potential risk factors simultaneously for a single outcome and is especially useful when prospective cohort studies are not feasible.\nThe author’s goal seems to be to improve the statistical power of the goodness-of-fit test for logistic regression models when used with case-control data. They improved upon a previous popular method from Qin and Zhang, instead of using the nonparametric empirical distribution function, we use the constrained nonparametric MLE of G(x) to further improve the power performance of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type goodness-of-fit test for logistic models.\nBefore drawing conclusions from a logistic regression model, it’s crucial to verify that the model’s assumptions hold true for the data and there are many limitations. Case Study data is specially complicated because there is not enough data and there are too many unknowns.\nThe authors spare no comments on the limitations, the bigger limitations are: - The test is designed for goodness-of-fit and cannot be used to compare two different logistic regression models - The test has no power when the only covariate is categorical. In this situation, the logistic model is “saturated,” meaning it perfectly fits the data by definition and cannot be misspecified.\nTheir results are overall quite interesting as they demonstrated that they could bootstrap an algorithm that is quite clever and intuitively it shouldn’t work. It is a hard problem to solve so it is interesting out of the box thinking\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Zhu M, Stanivuk S, Petrovic A, Nikolic M, Lio P.

    "text": "Article 2\nArticle used: Binary logistic regression analysis of factors affecting urban road traffic safety. (2)\nProblem: The introduction features a literature review establishing relevance of the topic. Several studies about traffic accidents are discussed and cited. Traffic accidents are becoming more common as traffic increases due to population increases. Researchers aim to find which factors in traffic are more closely associated with the occurrence of traffic accidents.\nSolution: The researchers use a binary logistic regression model to study which factors are more correlated to the occurrence of traffic accidents. The advantages of a binary logistic regression are discussed. Logistic regression allows researchers to make predictions about probability of a dependent variable being sorted into a certain class. Logistic regression also allows for the researchers to determine which predictors more significantly impact the outcome variable. To set up the study, researchers defined the dependent variable, y, as a binary outcome of either no accident (value of 0) or presence of an accident (value of 1). The independent variables are defined as 25 factors that are grouped under four categories consisting of environmental factors, driver attributes, road attributes, and vehicle factors. Before analyzing the data, it was preprocessed to eliminate outliers, normalize all predictor values to similar scales, eliminate redundancy, Then, the predictors were run through a multicollinearity test to determine if any needed to be excluded from the model; none of the factors showed significant multicollinearity and all 25 were kept in the model. The calculation used for collinearity involved the correlation coefficient, R, tolerance (T), and variance inflation factor (V).\nResults: A binary logistic regression model was fitted to the data, and it was found that the model fit well. To assess the goodness of fit, the determination coefficient, R^2, value was calculated. The strongest predictors of a traffic incident were found to be driver behavior, weather, road conditions, and lighting.\nLimitations: The paper states that research in this area can be improved by using real- time data about weather, road conditions, and driver status. Using data as it occurs in real time may help make better predictions about traffic safety risks.\nDataset: The original data was sourced from the International Transport Forum with 5350 datapoints. After data preprocessing, the data was reduced to 3500 data points.\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Sperandei S. Understanding logistic regression analysis. Biochemia medica. 2014;24(1):12–8. \n\n\n2.

(1)\nAuthors: Abebew Aklog smare, Yitateku Adugna Agmas\nProblem: - In children under five years of age, malnutrition and anemia have been an ongoing problem in many African countries. This paper focuses on studying malnutrition and anemia in Rwanda in particular; Rwanda went through a civil war, and after the war, rates of malnutrition and anemia decreased as the country was rebuilt. However, different parts of the country experienced faster or slower rates of improvement of malnutrition and anemia after the war, and it is unclear which factors are associated with improved rates of malnutrition and anemia. This study aims to identify key predictors correlated with these health ailments, so that the areas of the country still suffering from high rates of these health problems can be given the correct types of aid to fix the problem of malnutrition and anemia. - The introduction of the paper cites a few studies that identify strong correlations with malnutrition and anemia in children under five. Some strong predictors found by other studies are the child’s age, parents’ education level, household economic class, geographic location, household food availability, child birth size, family size, maternal age, and more. - The introduction states that this topic is relevant because although there is already existing research on malnutrition and anemia in African countries, there is not much literature studying the relationship between the two health conditions. This study aims to analyze the relationship between malnutrition and anemia in children in addition to identifying strong predictors of the conditions.\nData: - Data is supplied by the 2019/20 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. The researchers obtained the samples themselves, and the sampling method is described in depth. The researchers chose 500 clusters from different areas all over the country, and then households were selected at random from these clusters to be surveyed. The resulting data consisted of 3205 data points consisting of data about children under the age of 5.\nSolution to problem: - Researchers used a bivariate binary logistic regression model. This model helps understand the relationship between the outcome variables, presence of malnutrition and presence of anemia. The outcome variables are both binary, taking on a value of 1 for present, or 0 for not present. The predictors consist of about 26 variables relating to the child’s health conditions, family information, details about the parents, and relevant geographic information. - Three models are presented. The first model is the bivariate binary logistic regression model. The second model is the equivalent, but it is in the form of the log odds. The third model discussed is the odds ratio, and it is used to assess the relationship between categorical predictors in the model. - The researchers used SPSS and R software to perform the analyses.\nResults: - Results shows that nearly half of the study participants had anemia and about one fifth had malnutrition. - Six significant predictors were found: mother’s age, drinking water, other children in household, child gender, birth order, and gender of household head. - The odds ratio was a value that was not 1, which indicates that the outcome variables are not statistically independent. The relationship that exists between the outcome variables is significant. - The goodness fit test used was a proportion of correct predictions to the number of observations. This result was about 89%, so the researchers conclude that the model was a good fit. - There is a discussion about possible causes of the significant relationship that was found between malnutrition and anemia in children under 5. Researchers cite other facts and figures about why these health conditions are strongly correlated.\nConclusion: - Increasing maternal education, supplementing with vitamin A and other nutrient dense foods, providing a healthy/ clean/ safe environment, and decreasing maternal anemia may help improve rates of malnutrition and anemia in children.\nLimitations of the study: - The only limitation discussed is that the data collected may be prone to errors. This means researchers can conclude there are strong correlations, but it cannot be stated that any of the relationships are causal."

    "text": "Article 2\nArticle Title: Using Binary logistic Regression to Detect Health Insurance Fraud. (2)\nAuthor: Baraah Samara, Ph.D. Student\nProblem: - Insurance fraud in health insurance industry. Specifically, patients treated at private clinics or hospitals. - Intro of the article explains why this topic is relevant. Between 1965 and 2008, the cost of healthcare increased significantly, and as a result, health insurance fraud has increased. There needs to be effective tools at detecting this fraud. - If fraud is decreased, it will help the economy as a whole, it will help insurance companies, and it will lower premium payments made by customers. - Fraud is committed by three types of entities: consumer, provider, and payer fraud. - Literature review cites common predictors of health insurance fraud: diagnoses, service cost, number of claims from individual, greatest costing claim, probability of anomaly, excessive charges by care facilities, and more.\nData: - Original dataset contained 26 independent variables - Data was collected from a time span of January 2022 through November 2022 - about 123,000 data points with no missing values. - The predictors are of varying types, including numerical, categorical, and binary values - The dependent variable is fraud, with a value of 1 for fraud present, or 0 for no fraud present.\nSolution to Problem:\nWhy they selected this model: - Building a binary logistic regression model to detect health insurance fraud - logistic regression is selected as the analytic technique because they want to assess effects of categorical variables on a categorical dependent variable. They also cite that logistic regression is the most accurate type of regression model with the kind of classification they are performing in this study. - Fraud detection commonly employs binary prediction models - The logistic regression model also provides estimates between 0 and 1, which help investigators estimate probability of fraud - Researchers provide the equation they use to calculate the log odds of the event of interest (occurrence of fraud)\nThe method: - They calculate likelihood of an individual committing fraud - They calculate total cost accrued by an individual. Then they perform the logistic regression using this calculation - The model works by identifying outliers and classifies them as potential fraudulent activity - Before testing the model, researchers hypothesize that there will be a positive relationship between overall cost accrued by patient and likelihood of fraud. Costs include doctor visit costs, prescription drug costs, lab costs, costs of medical symptoms, and total cost of expensive prescriptions. - When running the model, none of the coefficients were zero, which means that there exists a significant relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables. - Predictors were tested for multicollinearity before the model was run. Pearson correlation coefficients were obtained, and any predictors with a Pearson value of greater than 0.8 were excluded from the model. Only eight predictors remained after removing the predictors that were strongly correlated. - Different models were constructed using only the most important predictors. When taking away the least important predictor, the log likelihood was calculated to assess the accuracy of the model. The best performing model contained six of the original predictors.\nResults: - Six predictors were found to be significant in predicting health insurance fraud. The predictors are office visit cost, prescription costs, lab costs, symptom cost, and two expensive prescription drug costs. - There is a thorough interpretation of model slopes. For example, “the likelihood of fraud increases by .005188 for every unit increase in pharmacy cost.” Interpretations for the most significant predictors are given in this way. - A Chi-Square test for independence was used to determine whether at least one predictor was significantly related to the outcome. It was concluded that at least one of the six predictors was significant. - The model was found to be about 99% accurate when predicting no fraud, but only about 76% accurate when predicting fraud. - An example is included that shows how to calculate the probability that an individual will commit insurance fraud, given values for the six predictors in the equation. - The study concludes by stating the importance and relevance of continuing to develop new fraud detection models.\nLimitations: - No limitations are explicitly stated in this paper. However, it can be considered a limitation that only data from middle eastern countries was used in the study. To make the results of the study more generalizable, data from other regions of the world should be included in a more comprehensive study.\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Asmare AA, Agmas YA.

(2)\nAuthors: Ann Hutchinson, Alastair Pickering, Paul Williams, Miriam Johnson\nProblem: - People presenting to the emergency room with breathlessness often do not require hospitalization and can be sent home. Only an average of 50% to 67% of these patients require admittance to the hospital. This research focuses on patients presenting with breathlessness to the ER and seeks to identify significant predictors of hospitalization of these individuals. Doctors and emergency department staff would benefit from identifying predictors present in individuals that would need to be admitted to the hospital.\nSolution: - Researchers used a binary logistic regression analysis to identify the predictors most strongly correlated with patients with breathlessness being admitted to the hospital from the ER. - First, in order to identify which predictors to include in the binary logistic regression, researchers analyzed 48 total predictors individually. They conducted a separate univariate analysis for each variable to see which were most significantly correlated with hospitalization from the ER. Only seven predictors were significant, and of those, only five were included in the final model (due to eliminating variables with strong multicollinearity).\nData: - Data was collected from a single hospital from December 2015 to May 2015. - Only 171 datapoints are included, as only 171 patients with acute breathlessness consented to have their survey used for research - Predictors included: demographics, preexisting medical conditions, severity of breathlessness, and other vital signs - To determine which predictors were most important, researchers used a stepwise backward elimination process, and excluded one predictor at a time. It was determined that only five predictors were needed. - After univariate analysis, researchers constructed a binary logistic regression model incorporating all of the selected predictors.\nResults and Conclusions: - Results are presented with an odds ratio for every predictor in the model. The odds of being admitted to the hospital increased by a certain factor for every one unit increase in a specific predictor. - The odds of admission to the hospital were positively correlated with age, talking to a doctor about symptoms, and the presence of preexisting heart conditions. The odds of being admitted to the hospital were negatively associated with blood oxygen levels. - The researchers state that this study is meant to only be exploratory and the results should not be used for making future predictions. Rather, the results should be used to aid in identifying strong predictors so these variables can be included in future similar studies. - Results of this study are compared to results of other studies, and the findings are consistent. A consistent predictor of hospital admission from this study and other studies includes older age. Another common predictor is tachycardia, but this study did not include this information.\nLimitations: - The study’s data is very limited. The data is supplied from just one hospital, and there were only 171 data points analyzed. The results of the study are therefore not as generalizable to global populations as a study analyzing broader populations. - The data also did not include responses from patients with very severe breathlessness because their state of health was too severe for them to be able to complete a survey. So the results of this study do not reflect patients with extreme symptoms.\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Lyu Y, Xu Q, Liu J.

    "text": "Introduction\nLogistic regression analysis is a type of regression technique that is used when a dataset’s response variable is categorical in nature. When the outcome variable takes on two distinct classes, a binary logistic regression model is used, and when there are more than two classes of the response variable, either a multinomial or ordinal logistic regression model can be utilized (1) (Kutner, 2013). Logistic regression analysis is commonly used across a variety of industries to glean insights about data to make optimal decisions about the data, to predict class labels, and to estimate probability of an event occurring; some fields include medicine, traffic and road engineering, environmental concerns, credit and fraud issues, and more. In this literature review, we take a closer look at logistic regression by discussing some applications of this algorithm in machine learning models, as well as several uses of logistic regression modeling in several peer- reviewed studies.\nMany machine learning algorithms use logistic regression to train a model and make predictions about class labels. One example of this is through text classification to improve natural language processing tasks. The article “From logistic regression to the perceptron algorithm: Exploring gradient descent with large step sizes” investigates similarities between a logistic regression algorithm with gradient descent and a perceptron algorithm. Researchers observed that with very large steps, the logistic regression with gradient descent behaves like a perceptron, which in some sense links it back to the Deep Equilibrium networks study. The conclusions from this paper are counter intuitive, and further research and reflections about classification and optimization theory are encouraged (2) (Tyurin, 2025). Another way logistic regression is used in machine learning is through large language models (LLMs), which are complex neural networks trained on very large datasets to output human language (3) (Pedapati et al., 2024). The paper “Large language model confidence estimation via black-box access” addresses the problem of estimating the confidence of LLM outputs when only black-box (query-only) access is available. It is a simple technique that uses logistic regression to classify and validate the confidence of the outputs. Some problems of using black-box models are that there is no control over the model itself, and in some cases, the benefits and the value of buying these services that provide a black-box model outweigh training a personal, custom model (Pedapti).\nLogistic regression analysis also assists road engineers and traffic control around the world by identifying common predictors of traffic accidents in general, and specifically, predictors of fatal accidents. According to The World Health Organization, one of the most common unnatural causes of death across the world is road accidents, so it is imperative to identify strong predictors associated with these events (4) (Akter et al., 2021). A different study from 2024 aimed to find which factors in traffic are strongly associated with the occurrence of traffic accidents (5) (Chang et al., 2024). Researchers used binary logistic regression to model the probability of a traffic accident occurring given a set of 25 predictors related to road safety. Another road traffic safety study from Bangladesh investigated strong predictors of motorcycle accidents. These researchers also utilized a binary logistic regression model to find strong predictors of severe accidents (4) (Akter, 2021). “Modeling Road Accident Severity with Logistic Regression (comparison study)” also exemplifies the use of a binary logistic regression model to analyze traffic risk (6) (Chen et al., 2020). Researchers compared the results of the logistic regression model to results of decision tree and random forest models, and it was found that the logistic regression model was more clear and understandable than the others. All three of these studies concluded by stating that there are several significant variables found when predicting severe road crashes. Knowing these significant predictors helps builders and developers eliminate or reduce these risk factors as they are building new roads; hence, it is crucial to continue researching road accident severity with logistic regression (4) (Akter, 2021).\nEnvironmental issues can also be studied using logistic regression analysis due to its interesting properties; after all, logistic regression is a generalized linear model, which conducts mapping from any real number to probability values. “Priority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods” seeks to address the problem of Asian giant hornets (7) (Liu et al., 2021). They are an invasive species that pose a significant threat to native bee populations and local beekeeping, as well as to public safety due to their aggressive nature and potent venom. The goal of the research is to create an automated system to predict the priority of Asian giant hornet sighting reports. The authors modeled the priority prediction of sighting reports as a two-classification problem, with classes being either a “true positive” or a “false positive.” Their methodology is a straightforward application of logistic regression with feature extraction. Researchers then used a weighted binary cross-entropy function and the logistic regression is used for mapping the probability given the feature vector. The model achieved an average prediction accuracy of 83.5% on positive reports with the best weighting parameter settings, but still far from other works which achieved about 93% using Deep Learning. It was concluded that this still needs a lot of improvement or maybe it will never outmatch other methods due to hidden limitations (7) (Liu et al., 2021). One other example of logistic regression used in environmental contexts is in the article “Autoregressive Logistic Regression Applied to Atmospheric Circulation Patterns” (8) (Guanche et al., 2014). Researchers incorporate autoregressive time dependencies into logistic regression for climate modeling. They work with complex climatological dynamic data, and they explain both interpretation and simulation capabilities for weather patterns (8) (Guanche et al., 2014).\nThe article “Understanding Logistic Regression Analysis” discusses the usefulness of logistic regression, describes how to interpret results of the model, and gives an example of a logistic regression analysis using a synthetic dataset (9) (Sperandi, 2014). The data is about patients undergoing a drug treatment with a categorical outcome that is binary in nature, taking on values of survived (1), or did not survive (0). The result of the analysis explains how to interpret output from the model; one must take the exponentials of the slopes in the model to find the chances (the probability) of an event occurring. It is noted that in order to correctly understand results of a logistic regression, one must carefully consider the differences between the odds ratio, the log odds, and the probabilities of events occurring. Another important point in the article outlines the process of feature selection; a common way that predictors are selected for a logistic regression model is through a preliminary univariate analysis. After conducting a univariate analysis of each predictor in relation to the outcome variable, all significant predictors are included in the final multivariate logistic regression analysis (9) (Sperandi).\nA 2024 study titled, “Determinants of coexistence of undernutrition and anemia among under- five children in Rwanda,” presents evidence from 2019/2020 demographic health survey data (10) . There are two outcome variables in the dataset: anemia and undernutrition in children under five years of age in Rwanda (10) (Agmas et al., 2024). The study analyzes the relationship between the two outcome variables, as well as the relationship between 26 predictors relating to the childrens’ preexisting health conditions, family information, details about the parents, and relevant geographic information. One result of the study was that the relationship between the two outcome variables, presence of malnutrition and presence of anemia, was found to be significant. Six other significant predictors were identified: mother’s age, drinking water quality, other children in household, child gender, birth order, and gender of head of household. The conclusion states that improving maternal education, supplementing with vitamin A and other nutrient dense foods, providing a healthy home environment, and decreasing maternal anemia may help improve rates of malnutrition and anemia in children (10) (Agmas, 2024).\nIn the study, “Predictors of hospital admission when presenting with acute on chronic breathlessness: Binary logistic regression” emergency room data from one hospital is analyzed to determine common predictors of patients that are admitted to the hospital (11) (Hutchinson et al., 2023). Specifically, patients presenting to the emergency room with acute on chronic breathlessness were surveyed to collect data that would help researchers understand common factors among those admitted to the hospital. Knowing common predictors ahead of time helps hospital staff more easily identify patients who are more at risk for being admitted to the hospital, and also helps identify which patients would be more likely to be able to be discharged without being admitted. A binary logistic regression analysis of the data revealed that the odds of admission to the hospital were positively correlated with three predictors: age, talking to a doctor about symptoms, and the presence of preexisting heart conditions. However, the odds of being admitted to the hospital were negatively associated with blood oxygen levels (11) (Hutchinson, 2023).\nA new medical condition was recently recognized in 2004: airplane headache (AH), a condition described as a headache induced while taking off or landing in an airplane (12) (Prottengeier et al., 2025). Because AH is a relatively new addition to medical dictionaries, it is an underexplored condition that requires additional research. This study sought to identify common risk factors significantly associated with airplane headache to aid both travelers and airline employees. Two binary logistic regression models were constructed to compare two groups against the airplane headache group. The first regression model compared the airplane headache group to the no headache group, and 10 significant predictors of AH were identified; this model’s predictive power was found to be very high. The second model compared the airplane headache group to a group called other headache (individuals with symptoms of other types of headaches). The result from this analysis showed four significant predictors; however, the predictive power of the model was found to be very low. To conclude, it can be stated that binary logistic regression is a very effective way to find strong predictors of airplane headache when compared to those who do not have any headaches while flying (12) (Prottengeier).\nOne other way logistic regression is applied in the medical field is in identifying how the general public makes decisions regarding their health (13) (Liu J. et al., 2024). Researchers in China analyzed 2696 health survey responses collected from individuals across 31 Chinese provinces. They analyzed the data with a binary logistic regression model to classify points into two categories: unilateral decision making (value of 1), or collaborative decision making (value of 0). The researchers wanted to identify top predictors of individuals that make medical decisions by themselves and which predictors are correlated with patients making health decisions with more than one party (i.e. a patient, doctor, and family member all helping to make the health decision). It was found that most responses were classified as collaborative decision making (70%), which supports the idea that individuals in China strongly emphasize family- made decisions and strong family values. It was also concluded that significant predictors of unilateral decision making were gender, education level, family status, religious beliefs and occupation (13) (Liu J., 2024).\nLogistic Regression is also useful in detecting common diseases, such as breast cancer. “Regularized logistic regression with network-based pairwise interaction for biomarker identification in breast cancer” uses regularized logistic regression along with biological network information and pairwise interactions, to find biomarkers, both single and interacting pairs, for breast cancer (14) (Wu et al., 2016). Researchers prioritized biologically plausible biomarker combinations and used an adaptive elastic net, a penalty that balances l1 and l2, with network constraints. The result of the study shows that their model outperforms simpler models in terms of predictive performance, and they were able to discover both individual biomarkers and interacting gene pairs (14) (Wu, 2016). Another study on breast cancer from 2016 aimed to identify gene signatures that predict chemosensitivity, that is, which tumors react to chemotherapy in breast cancer by combining genetic algorithms with sparse logistic regression (15) (Hu, 2016). What makes this analysis relevant and important is that it predicts which patients will react to chemotherapy, which gives more personalized treatment. The results show that SLR-28 and Notch-86, two gene signatures, perform well on training and validation sets in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and other metrics (15) (Hu, 2016).\nIn this paper, we will discuss the methodology, analysis, results, visualizations, and conclusions of a binary logistic regression statistical analysis regarding risk of stroke from common health indicators. Stroke is the second most common cause of death globally, so understanding the risk factors associated with it is imperative (16) (“The Top 10”, 2024).\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Kutner MH.

    "title": "Logistic Regression Group - Report",
    "section": "test",
    "text": "test\nLogistic regression analysis is a type of regression technique that is used when a dataset’s response variable is categorical in nature. When the outcome variable takes on two distinct classes, a binary logistic regression model is used, and when there are more than two classes of the response variable, either a multinomial or ordinal logistic regression model can be utilized (1) (Kutner, 2013). Logistic regression analysis is commonly used across a variety of industries to glean insights about data to make optimal decisions about the data, to predict class labels, and to estimate probability of an event occurring; some fields include medicine, traffic and road engineering, environmental concerns, credit and fraud issues, and more. In this literature review, we take a closer look at logistic regression by discussing some applications of this algorithm in machine learning models, as well as several uses of logistic regression modeling in several peer- reviewed studies.\nMany machine learning algorithms use logistic regression to train a model and make predictions about class labels. One example of this is through text classification to improve natural language processing tasks. The article “From logistic regression to the perceptron algorithm: Exploring gradient descent with large step sizes” investigates similarities between a logistic regression algorithm with gradient descent and a perceptron algorithm. Researchers observed that with very large steps, the logistic regression with gradient descent behaves like a perceptron, which in some sense links it back to the Deep Equilibrium networks study. The conclusions from this paper are counter intuitive, and further research and reflections about classification and optimization theory are encouraged (2) (Tyurin, 2025). Another way logistic regression is used in machine learning is through large language models (LLMs), which are complex neural networks trained on very large datasets to output human language (3) (Pedapati et al., 2024). The paper “Large language model confidence estimation via black-box access” addresses the problem of estimating the confidence of LLM outputs when only black-box (query-only) access is available. It is a simple technique that uses logistic regression to classify and validate the confidence of the outputs. Some problems of using black-box models are that there is no control over the model itself, and in some cases, the benefits and the value of buying these services that provide a black-box model outweigh training a personal, custom model (Pedapti).\nLogistic regression analysis also assists road engineers and traffic control around the world by identifying common predictors of traffic accidents in general, and specifically, predictors of fatal accidents. According to The World Health Organization, one of the most common unnatural causes of death across the world is road accidents, so it is imperative to identify strong predictors associated with these events (4) (Akter et al., 2021). A different study from 2024 aimed to find which factors in traffic are strongly associated with the occurrence of traffic accidents (5) (Chang et al., 2024). Researchers used binary logistic regression to model the probability of a traffic accident occurring given a set of 25 predictors related to road safety. Another road traffic safety study from Bangladesh investigated strong predictors of motorcycle accidents. These researchers also utilized a binary logistic regression model to find strong predictors of severe accidents (4) (Akter, 2021). “Modeling Road Accident Severity with Logistic Regression (comparison study)” also exemplifies the use of a binary logistic regression model to analyze traffic risk (6) (Chen et al., 2020). Researchers compared the results of the logistic regression model to results of decision tree and random forest models, and it was found that the logistic regression model was more clear and understandable than the others. All three of these studies concluded by stating that there are several significant variables found when predicting severe road crashes. Knowing these significant predictors helps builders and developers eliminate or reduce these risk factors as they are building new roads; hence, it is crucial to continue researching road accident severity with logistic regression (4) (Akter, 2021).\nEnvironmental issues can also be studied using logistic regression analysis due to its interesting properties; after all, logistic regression is a generalized linear model, which conducts mapping from any real number to probability values. “Priority prediction of Asian Hornet sighting report using machine learning methods” seeks to address the problem of Asian giant hornets (7) (Liu et al., 2021). They are an invasive species that pose a significant threat to native bee populations and local beekeeping, as well as to public safety due to their aggressive nature and potent venom. The goal of the research is to create an automated system to predict the priority of Asian giant hornet sighting reports. The authors modeled the priority prediction of sighting reports as a two-classification problem, with classes being either a “true positive” or a “false positive.” Their methodology is a straightforward application of logistic regression with feature extraction. Researchers then used a weighted binary cross-entropy function and the logistic regression is used for mapping the probability given the feature vector. The model achieved an average prediction accuracy of 83.5% on positive reports with the best weighting parameter settings, but still far from other works which achieved about 93% using Deep Learning. It was concluded that this still needs a lot of improvement or maybe it will never outmatch other methods due to hidden limitations (7) (Liu et al., 2021). One other example of logistic regression used in environmental contexts is in the article “Autoregressive Logistic Regression Applied to Atmospheric Circulation Patterns” (8) (Guanche et al., 2014). Researchers incorporate autoregressive time dependencies into logistic regression for climate modeling. They work with complex climatological dynamic data, and they explain both interpretation and simulation capabilities for weather patterns (8) (Guanche et al., 2014).\nThe article “Understanding Logistic Regression Analysis” discusses the usefulness of logistic regression, describes how to interpret results of the model, and gives an example of a logistic regression analysis using a synthetic dataset (9) (Sperandi, 2014). The data is about patients undergoing a drug treatment with a categorical outcome that is binary in nature, taking on values of survived (1), or did not survive (0). The result of the analysis explains how to interpret output from the model; one must take the exponentials of the slopes in the model to find the chances (the probability) of an event occurring. It is noted that in order to correctly understand results of a logistic regression, one must carefully consider the differences between the odds ratio, the log odds, and the probabilities of events occurring. Another important point in the article outlines the process of feature selection; a common way that predictors are selected for a logistic regression model is through a preliminary univariate analysis. After conducting a univariate analysis of each predictor in relation to the outcome variable, all significant predictors are included in the final multivariate logistic regression analysis (9) (Sperandi).\nA 2024 study titled, “Determinants of coexistence of undernutrition and anemia among under- five children in Rwanda,” presents evidence from 2019/2020 demographic health survey data (10) . There are two outcome variables in the dataset: anemia and undernutrition in children under five years of age in Rwanda (10) (Agmas et al., 2024). The study analyzes the relationship between the two outcome variables, as well as the relationship between 26 predictors relating to the childrens’ preexisting health conditions, family information, details about the parents, and relevant geographic information. One result of the study was that the relationship between the two outcome variables, presence of malnutrition and presence of anemia, was found to be significant. Six other significant predictors were identified: mother’s age, drinking water quality, other children in household, child gender, birth order, and gender of head of household. The conclusion states that improving maternal education, supplementing with vitamin A and other nutrient dense foods, providing a healthy home environment, and decreasing maternal anemia may help improve rates of malnutrition and anemia in children (10) (Agmas, 2024).\nIn the study, “Predictors of hospital admission when presenting with acute on chronic breathlessness: Binary logistic regression” emergency room data from one hospital is analyzed to determine common predictors of patients that are admitted to the hospital (11) (Hutchinson et al., 2023). Specifically, patients presenting to the emergency room with acute on chronic breathlessness were surveyed to collect data that would help researchers understand common factors among those admitted to the hospital. Knowing common predictors ahead of time helps hospital staff more easily identify patients who are more at risk for being admitted to the hospital, and also helps identify which patients would be more likely to be able to be discharged without being admitted. A binary logistic regression analysis of the data revealed that the odds of admission to the hospital were positively correlated with three predictors: age, talking to a doctor about symptoms, and the presence of preexisting heart conditions. However, the odds of being admitted to the hospital were negatively associated with blood oxygen levels (11) (Hutchinson, 2023).\nA new medical condition was recently recognized in 2004: airplane headache (AH), a condition described as a headache induced while taking off or landing in an airplane (12) (Prottengeier et al., 2025). Because AH is a relatively new addition to medical dictionaries, it is an underexplored condition that requires additional research. This study sought to identify common risk factors significantly associated with airplane headache to aid both travelers and airline employees. Two binary logistic regression models were constructed to compare two groups against the airplane headache group. The first regression model compared the airplane headache group to the no headache group, and 10 significant predictors of AH were identified; this model’s predictive power was found to be very high. The second model compared the airplane headache group to a group called other headache (individuals with symptoms of other types of headaches). The result from this analysis showed four significant predictors; however, the predictive power of the model was found to be very low. To conclude, it can be stated that binary logistic regression is a very effective way to find strong predictors of airplane headache when compared to those who do not have any headaches while flying (12) (Prottengeier).\nOne other way logistic regression is applied in the medical field is in identifying how the general public makes decisions regarding their health (13) (Liu J. et al., 2024). Researchers in China analyzed 2696 health survey responses collected from individuals across 31 Chinese provinces. They analyzed the data with a binary logistic regression model to classify points into two categories: unilateral decision making (value of 1), or collaborative decision making (value of 0). The researchers wanted to identify top predictors of individuals that make medical decisions by themselves and which predictors are correlated with patients making health decisions with more than one party (i.e. a patient, doctor, and family member all helping to make the health decision). It was found that most responses were classified as collaborative decision making (70%), which supports the idea that individuals in China strongly emphasize family- made decisions and strong family values. It was also concluded that significant predictors of unilateral decision making were gender, education level, family status, religious beliefs and occupation (13) (Liu J., 2024).\nLogistic Regression is also useful in detecting common diseases, such as breast cancer. “Regularized logistic regression with network-based pairwise interaction for biomarker identification in breast cancer” uses regularized logistic regression along with biological network information and pairwise interactions, to find biomarkers, both single and interacting pairs, for breast cancer (14) (Wu et al., 2016). Researchers prioritized biologically plausible biomarker combinations and used an adaptive elastic net, a penalty that balances l1 and l2, with network constraints. The result of the study shows that their model outperforms simpler models in terms of predictive performance, and they were able to discover both individual biomarkers and interacting gene pairs (14) (Wu, 2016). Another study on breast cancer from 2016 aimed to identify gene signatures that predict chemosensitivity, that is, which tumors react to chemotherapy in breast cancer by combining genetic algorithms with sparse logistic regression (15) (Hu, 2016). What makes this analysis relevant and important is that it predicts which patients will react to chemotherapy, which gives more personalized treatment. The results show that SLR-28 and Notch-86, two gene signatures, perform well on training and validation sets in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and other metrics (15) (Hu, 2016).\nIn this paper, we will discuss the methodology, analysis, results, visualizations, and conclusions of a binary logistic regression statistical analysis regarding risk of stroke from common health indicators. Stroke is the second most common cause of death globally, so understanding the risk factors associated with it is imperative (16) (“The Top 10”, 2024).\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Kutner MH.

The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that the library is used every time you open that project.\nAs you continue to work on your project, you will install and upgrade packages, either using install.packages() and update.packages() or renv::install() and renv::update(). After you’ve confirmed your code works as expected, use renv::snapshot() to record the packages and their sources in the lockfile.\nLater, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile."
